## Motivation
To practice the design/implementation/deployment of a full-stack MERN app and to try and integrate the Socket.IO library to send/receive messages in realtime. An app like this has so much room for development of new features that could keep me busy for a LONG TIME, as such, I wanted to first deploy the basic functionality.

## Features
- User auth using JWT (sign up, sign in, sign out)
- Persistent user accounts/contacts/conversations
- Add contacts using their email
- Create chat rooms using saved contacts

## Technology/Frameworks
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents with flexible schemas
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, minimalist, backend web framework for Node.js
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend, JavaScript library for UI development of mobile/single-page apps
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Backend, JavaScript runtime environment for asynchronous, event-driven I/O used to make scalable network apps
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) - JavaScript library for realtime web apps that enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers
